          <p>i will use various analogies to explain how you can learn programming and hopefully one will make sense :)</p>

          <p><strong>a. Programming as a language:</strong></p>

          <p>If you want to learn a new language, you have to follow a specific order of learning things. While so many ways exist, here is a process i am a fan of:<br>
              (Disclaimer - i can speak French and English and currently learning Arabic this is 2018 O.o)</p>

          <p><strong>1. Learn the basics of the language first</strong> till you are comfortable.<br>
              This is so priceless. When learning a language(#WLAL), you start by learning the most commonly used vocabulary, like greetings etc.then you build up to learn verbs, adjectives and nouns of that programming language.<br>
              You never get to start with complex conversations like past tense -  but you get there after knowing how the basics of the language looks like and works.<br>
              It's the same thing in programming(#iTSTIP)! You start by learning the basics of the language: Syntax and the building blocks of that language: the small stuff like variables and functions and methods are some things you should know how to write.
          </p>

          <p><strong>2. Start building small things with what you have learnt.</strong><br>
              #WLAL, you begin practing it by making small sentences that are simplistic and do not wow anyone.(Anyone teaching you will tell you to go and speak what you know- eveb as you are learning). The aim is to throw yourself into a situation where your mind can easily construct sentences in varied situations.</p>
              <p>#iTSTIP: you have to start practicing by building very small every day things. Small can be anything like a multiple choice quiz app that simply prompts someone to answer a set of abcd questions....and you build on from there.</p>

          <p><strong>3. Expose yourself.</strong><br>
              #WLAL, You can only improve your language by exposing yourself to native speakers of that language.
              This could be by:<br>
              1. watching movies and channels that speak in that native language, <br>
              2. meeting people from that language and speaking with them -  they will encourage you and help you- while travelling to that country is great, there are local communities of that specific language. Get in them.<br>
              3. reading books in that native language.<br>
              4...anything that ensures that you are not aloof from where the language and in extension that culture.
          </p>
              <p>#iTSTIP: Join a community and watch alot of techology talks. But be careful when watching and practicing. you are growing in the language, be patient enough to learn the foundations but open your eyes and learn from people. </p>

            <p><strong>Warning!</strong> Avoid distractions and being distracted by 'the shiny toy of the day. If its android you want, get in and struggle.It aint easy. if it was everyone would be building it.</p>

          <p><strong>4. LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS.</strong><br>
              #WLAL, you have to get to a point where you can make complex joined sentences to facilitate your spoken language ability.</p>
          <p>#iTSTIP: DSA as its popular with its acronym, is a key thing! The ability to create algorithms to do the very simple and mundane tasks goes a long way in doing more and depeer things. Grasping things like sorting algorithms etc helps us be able to solve the various challenges that are posed to us. It's perilious to say you can code and take up jobs if this is something you cant do. </p>
