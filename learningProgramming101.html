          <p>i will use various analogies of learning programming and hopefully one will make sense :)</p>

          <p><strong>a.Programming as a language:</strong></p>

          <p>If you want to learn a new language, you have to follow a specific order of learning things. While so many ways exist, here is a process i am a fan of:<br>
              (Disclaimer - i can speak French and English and currently learning Arabic this is 2018 O.o)</p>

          <p><strong>1. Learn the basics of the language first</strong> till you are comfortable.<br>
              This is so priceless. When learning a language(#WLAL), you start by learning the most commonly used vocabulary, like greetings etc.then you build up to learn verbs, adjectives and nouns of that programming language.<br>
              You never get to start with complex conversations like past tense -  but you get there after knowing how the basics of the language looks like and works.<br>
              It's the same thing in programming(#iTSTIP)! You start by learning the basics of the language: Syntax and the building blocks of that language: the small stuff like variables and functions and methods are some things you should know how to write.
          </p>

          <p><strong>2. Start building small things with what you have learnt.</strong><br>
              #WLAL, you begin practing it by making small sentences that are simplistic and do not wow anyone.(Anyone teaching you will tell you to go and speak what you know- eveb as you are learning). The aim is to throw yourself into a situation where your mind can easily construct sentences in varied situations.</p>
              <p>#iTSTIP: you have to start practicing by building very small every day things. Small can be anything like a multiple choice quiz app that simply prompts someone to answer a set of abcd questions....and you build on from there.</p>

          <p>3. Read various Android Source Code and try se the way others are implementing various things. </p>
